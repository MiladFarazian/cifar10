# CIFAR-10 Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This project implements an image classification model using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes.

## Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to build and train a CNN model that can accurately classify images into one of the ten classes in the CIFAR-10 dataset. The steps involved in this project are:

1. Load and preprocess the CIFAR-10 dataset.
2. Build the CNN model.
3. Compile and train the model.
4. Evaluate the model's performance.
5. Visualize the training history and predictions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

Install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib

```
